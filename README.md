# wat4hjs [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/wat4hjs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wat4hjs)

1. What:
wat4hjs is a JavaScript wrapper for native C code that allows some code to "watch" a directory for changes. Changes can include:
   1. Creation of files
   1. Modification of files
   1. Renaming of files
   1. Deletion of files
1. Why: 
At the time of writing this, most libraries and packages that existed did not include the functionality I was looking for. In most cases they would either be a platform abstraction layer or perhaps, not run the code natively. This package is a wrapper to a C library that is shipped as part of the package.
1. When:
The first commit was featured in January of 2024, continued support expected.
